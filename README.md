# ðŸš— Urban Parking Dynamic Pricing System

This project simulates real-time dynamic pricing for urban parking lots using occupancy, traffic, and contextual data. Implemented using **Pathway** for stream simulation and processing, and **Bokeh** + **Panel** for interactive time-series visualizations.

## ðŸ§  Overview

With increasing urbanization, demand for smart parking systems has grown. This project presents two models for calculating dynamic prices for parking lots based on real-time data streams. It leverages time, location, vehicle type, traffic conditions, and queue length to model pricing dynamically.

---

## ðŸ§© Problem Statement

> Build a streaming application that:
>
> - Simulates live parking lot data.
> - Computes dynamic parking prices using **two distinct pricing models**.
> - Outputs interactive plots per parking lot to track how prices evolve over time.

## ðŸ§ª Model Descriptions

### âœ… Model 1 (Simple Pricing Model)
- **Price = base_rate Ã— occupancy rate + queue length adjustment**
- No contextual factors like traffic or time.
- Serves as a baseline pricing mechanism.

### âœ… Model 2 (Advanced Weighted Pricing Model)
- Price is computed using the following weighted formula:

Demand = Î± * (Occupancy / Capacity)
+ Î² * QueueLength
+ Î³ * TrafficWeight
+ Î´ * IsSpecialDay
+ Îµ * VehicleTypeWeight
+ Î¶ * HourFactor


- Final price: Price = BASE_PRICE * (1 + Î» * NormalizedDemand)

- Bounded between 0.5Ã— and 2Ã— of base price.

---

## Project Workflow

### 1. Input Source
The input comes from `dataset.csv`, containing:
- Occupancy and capacity of each lot
- Queue length
- Vehicle type (car, truck, bike)
- Traffic condition (low, medium, high)
- Date and time of observation

---

### 2. Ingestion and Preprocessing (Pathway)
- Data is loaded via `pathway.io.csv.read()` in **static mode**
- Invalid rows are removed (e.g., negative occupancy)
- Timestamps are merged into `datetime_str`
- Hour of day is extracted for later modeling

---

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Assign **vehicle type weight** (e.g., truck = 1.5, bike = 0.5)
- Assign **traffic weight** (e.g., high = 1.3, low = 1.0)
- Compute **occupancy rate** = `Occupancy / Capacity`

---

### 4. Pricing Models

#### Model 1
Simple model:
```
Price = (Occupancy / Capacity) * 10
```

#### Model 2
Advanced pricing using weighted demand score:
```
Demand Score = Î±Â·(Occupancy/Capacity) + Î²Â·Queue + Î³Â·Traffic + Î´Â·SpecialDay + ÎµÂ·VehicleWeight + Î¶Â·HourFactor
```
- Scores are normalized and converted to price
- Price is bounded between **0.5x** and **2x** base price (base = â‚¹10)

---

### 5. Output Generation
- Final enriched output is written to `model2_output.csv`
- Includes: demand score, normalized demand, and computed dynamic price

---

### 6. Visualization (Bokeh + Panel)
- Output is read using **pandas**
- Time-series line plots show price variation across parking lots
- Interactive Bokeh chart rendered inside Jupyter using Panel
