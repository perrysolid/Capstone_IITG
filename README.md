# ðŸš— Urban Parking Dynamic Pricing System

This project simulates real-time dynamic pricing for urban parking lots using occupancy, traffic, and contextual data. Implemented using **Pathway** for stream simulation and processing, and **Bokeh** + **Panel** for interactive time-series visualizations.

## ðŸ§  Overview

With increasing urbanization, demand for smart parking systems has grown. This project presents two models for calculating dynamic prices for parking lots based on real-time data streams. It leverages time, location, vehicle type, traffic conditions, and queue length to model pricing dynamically.

---

## ðŸ§© Problem Statement

> Build a streaming application that:
>
> - Simulates live parking lot data.
> - Computes dynamic parking prices using **two distinct pricing models**.
> - Outputs interactive plots per parking lot to track how prices evolve over time.

## ðŸ§ª Model Descriptions

### âœ… Model 1 (Simple Pricing Model)
- **Price = base_rate Ã— occupancy rate + queue length adjustment**
- No contextual factors like traffic or time.
- Serves as a baseline pricing mechanism.

### âœ… Model 2 (Advanced Weighted Pricing Model)
- Price is computed using the following weighted formula:

Demand = Î± * (Occupancy / Capacity)
+ Î² * QueueLength
+ Î³ * TrafficWeight
+ Î´ * IsSpecialDay
+ Îµ * VehicleTypeWeight
+ Î¶ * HourFactor


- Final price: Price = BASE_PRICE * (1 + Î» * NormalizedDemand)

- Bounded between 0.5Ã— and 2Ã— of base price.
